# About the project: Healthcare efficiency in the UK

<b>This project will focus on UK healthcare spending using multiple public datasets.</b>

## Possible questions to investigate

- How does UK healthcare spending change over the years compared with other countries? 
- Any characteristics of healthcare financing, consumption, etc., in the UK (based on the data) that are different from other countries? 
- How is the efficiency of funds for UK healthcare? 
- How is the effect of certain events (e.g., Brexit, COVID) on healthcare supply, demand, etc. (itâ€™s commonly known the NHS is battling with staff shortages, especially became apparent during COVID)?
